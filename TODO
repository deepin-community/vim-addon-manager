Short term
==========

- Get vim to load vimrc files provided by packages:

  " Support .d-style configuration directory. All files under /etc/vim/vimrc.d/
  " will be sourced.
  for rcfile in split(glob('/etc/vim/vimrc.d/*.vim'))
    execute 'source ' . rcfile
  endfor

- update documentation:

  + vim-policy (debian/policy/ on vim source package)

  Note the fact that new-style addons must provide pre-built tag files

- figure out the upgrade path for addons that move from the "everything mixed
  together in /usr/share/vim/addons" to the "new layout", i.e. all addon files
  together, separated from other addons, in
  /usr/share/vim/addons/$whatever/$addonname

  - add a `cleanup` command to remove dangling symlinks from the target
    directory?

  - add an `upgrade` command to figure out which addons should be installed
    based on the dangling symlinks, them removing those symlinks and
    re-installing the addons in the new way?

    - addons could just change the 'files' attribute to 'oldfiles' or something
      like that, so that they could reconstruct objects using the legacy addon
      class, them remove the legacy installations, then installing the new
      addon.

Middle/Long term
================

- Allow the admin to declare whether they want registered addons to be
  automatically installed system-wide.  Use debconf & dpkg triggers?

- implement some way to install stuff from remote servers:
  - git repositories
  - .zip files from vim.org
  - etc

  It would be cooler if these addons first went into a separate registry (e.g.
  /var/lib/vim/registry/ system-wide and ~/.vim/registry and them were
  installed like regular addons)

- look closer at http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2905

  we must fix the view that vim-addon-manager is "Debian specific"
